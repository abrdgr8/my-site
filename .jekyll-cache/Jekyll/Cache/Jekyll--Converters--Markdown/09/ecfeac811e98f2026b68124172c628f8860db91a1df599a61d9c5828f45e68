<p>#2 -  INEQUALITY and INEFFICIENCY
Why some people are rich ?  Why some people are poor ?<br />
If God exists, why did he allow the impoverished to scavenge food in the filthiest of places like garbage and dump sites? .
Why is there so much inequality everywhere around the world? Children, dying from hunger, Is it a matter of personal choice? because they canâ€™t find a decent job or they didnâ€™t study hard enough thatâ€™s why they are suffering this terrible fate of severe hunger and unemployment?  These are some of the questions that an ordinary Filipino like me has in his stream of consciousness from time to time.
As I was brainstorming on what to write for todayâ€™s blog, our home internet was down and itâ€™s been recurring for several months now that sometimes it would take up to 3 weeks before the connection is fully restored,  so a typical consumerâ€™s first logical action would be to call this particular (ISP) / companyâ€™s hotline, and thankfully, when they promised a solution to my cousin over the phone, there was some relief that I felt, but as I waited for several days to pass, I wasnâ€™t satisfied with whatâ€™s happening, which irked me as I owed money from my aunt paid and 1,700 pesos for a recurring intermittent internet connection, Consequently, I had to find another way for a second solution and that is to visit this ISPâ€™s Facebook page and to my surprise, most of their customers had it even worse that it dissipated my interest to report this issue thru Facebook since it has more or less 100 comments who are currently on  the same boat with me. So, the last resort would be to go to this ISPâ€™s local office and report this issue, which is the most sensible thing to do since their hotline is of no use and it seems reporting online wonâ€™t solve my case either as many of their customers there was showing utter dissatisfaction with how this particularly ISP were handling their problem, this instance for example is an inequality that an ordinary citizen of this country has been enduring for so many years now.<br />
In order to formulate a perfect strategy to solve this problem that we might face from time to time, I decided to compare our current situation to a country with a much better internet connectivity and that is Taiwan.
COUNTRY COMPARISON
One of those countries with the best internet connections thatâ€™s closest to Philippinesâ€™ proximity is Taiwan
By comparing our ISPâ€™s to theirs, we will be able to devise a strategy on how we can improve ours.
Geographically, Taiwan has the upper hand as it is an archipelagic country with few islands, Philippines on the other hand is an archipelagic country with its 7,107 islands, a banal trivia that some experts will find it daunting for the Philippines to build a robust internet infrastructure as it requires a lot of resources to maintain such infrastructure with the complexity of bridging it thru multiple islands.</p>

<p>Here we show an internet speed test comparison between the two, Taiwanâ€™s geographical advantage proved to be noticeable, as it has few geographic islands compared to our 7,107 islands.  But if our governmentâ€™s long-term goal is to improve our internet reliability, why not we look into a partnership with Starlink who uses low-orbit satellites to establish internet connectivity as a short-term solution to unreliable internet connection, and after that, create a plan to make it accessible and affordable to every working age Filipinos, 18-55 years old so that they can continue their work remotely or from home while gradually devising a comprehensive fiber-optic infrastructure to power its 7,107 islands that would take several years to complete.  <br />
THE FEW, THE PROUD, THE OLIGARCHS
I just quoted and used a famous Marine slogan because itâ€™s good to use quotes as analogy to get your point across.
While Taiwan had at least 15 competing ISPâ€™s, Philippines had more or less 5 companies competing but 2 of them are considered to be the main players in this game that economists would label these few privileged people as oligarchs that introduced us to a power structure called oligarchy, which comes from the Greek words oligoi (â€˜the fewâ€™) , and arkhein (â€˜to ruleâ€™) ruled over us for several years that it dwindled our economic and civil rights for so long.  But thankfully, a leader with populist ideals was elected in this land 7 years ago, and for that, we will give credit to former President Rodrigo Duterte for going after these decadent capitalists and imposed the law to this few whoâ€™s been cheating the government and the benighted people of this country. As a result of his political actions, we were able to balance the power, gradually dismantled and exposed these oligarchâ€™s decadent ways by collected the appropriate amount of taxes and imposed the law to them. 
Just so you guys know, I am not a political expert or someone who finished a political degree in a university, and as a matter of personal choice, I donâ€™t want to have any political bias or affiliation to any political families or parties as I donâ€™t like to be associated with anyone of them as Iâ€™ve seen throughout the history how divisive politics can make things go awry and how leaders can cause chaos and atrocities just because of their own personal political ambitions.  Second World War, the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Jihad are some of the best examples of this, although war is inevitable, still atrocities can be prevented if the leaders we choose were more restrained and people-centric, Iâ€™m just an ordinary citizen who reads the news and history books occasionally and someone who just wants his voice to be heard through blogging. Iâ€™m not someone who gets paid to promote any politician or a Pro - Duterte writer/blogger, as I didnâ€™t vote for him simply because I donâ€™t agree with some of his political stances, such as committing EJKâ€™s to solve crimes and for giving a Heroâ€™s burial to the late former President Marcos.  But, I personally believe that in politics even if we donâ€™t share the same views and belief systems, but if we can come up with a solution to societyâ€™s pressing issues like corruption, hunger, unemployment, inflation, peace and security then I will always support the leader who has the electoral mandate, no matter how the leader tackles the problem, cause in this world we live in, there are no absolutes, and that applies to solutions and truths as well, applying the Law of Paradox in politics, Therefore, we have to give credit to the man, for giving us radical results and for doing his best in trying to put an end to 2010-2016â€™s biggest problems such as the widespread increase of petty and heinous crimes, the annoying Tanim-Bala cases and trying to put an end to widespread corruption in the government since in retrospect, under the former Presidentâ€™s time, there were no fixers in LTO, and there was strong implementation of AMLCâ€™s policies, that surely shows his anti-corruption drive, and thatâ€™s something to be appreciated if youâ€™re a law-abiding citizen of this country.
But still, how can we achieve a lasting change that the previous government initiated through its Change is Coming campaign slogan during 2016 elections period, when everywhere we go we still hear the same inequality brought by the same inefficient government practices that is still is being practiced. Even Pork barrel that was heavily opposed by the late Senator Miriam Defensor â€“ Santiago and was once declared as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, still exists, When sub-standard government projects are still being constructed everywhere in the country due to some lawmakers and Mayors demanding up to 40 percent cuts from the intended budget resulting to terrible government infrastructure such as bridges and the flood-control systems that we actually needed the most in this confounding El NiÃ±o season proved to be ineffective, Retired police general and the current mayor of Baguio City, Mayor Benjamin Magalong took all this exposes to The Chiefsâ€™ on One News last July 6, 2023.</p>

<p>Before I started writing this blog, I had twofold plans in mind, first is to expose some truths and problems to my readers and right after that propose a solution on how we can solve the problems we face in order to attain the utopia that I always dreamed about.  But, in my mindâ€™s eye, I donâ€™t see that happening,  not in the near future, given the fact that even the neophyte legislators that weâ€™ve elected from the famous political families that weâ€™ve entrusted our voting confidence are even involved in such corrupt practices. And even though the executive has all the power to stand up against all this unconstitutional practices, I canâ€™t seem to feel any actions coming from the president who got an overwhelming electoral mandate last year. Maybe he wonâ€™t do it as his loyalty is to the political and economic hegemons that ruled over us for so many years; the oligarchs who disguised themselves as corporations or heâ€™s just a weak leader after all, itâ€™s just his innate character. Whatever it is, weâ€™ve wasted so many good leaders in the past that couldâ€™ve given us an effective and an efficient government.  Perhaps what we need is another revolution that would lead to a military junta to instill discipline in this morally depraved society. Maybe thatâ€™s all we need.</p>

<p>NOTES : 
story of Inquisition on how the Catholic Churchâ€™s atrocities, so itâ€™s not new that 
as throughout the history we were able to elect to power leaders who proved to incompetent, corrupt and wicked leaders who orchestrated mass murders of innocent, children so studying the history , we will be able to make better decisions politically and</p>

<p>So a business that promotes inequality will benefit from an ineffective, inefficient slow government, itâ€™s a no brainer.</p>
