Is this the real life ? Is this just fantasy ? Caught up in a landslide ? Look into the sky and see ?  A rainy el nino season ? 


Earlier this month, news outlets informed the public that El Nino is already here but why is it we see flooding everywhere in the countryside, urban and suburban areas? Maybe It’s not just El Nino Vodka but with a twist of Climate Change Martini perhaps? 


This has got to be one of those firsts in our lifetime to experience a rainy El Nino season, Pretty much the same with my aunt who’s in her 70s already, to see an onion with such an oddly hefty increase in price last year or was it several months ago?  


Is this another one of those fake news? but this time from someone we expect to be credible our very own meteorological agency, PAG-ASA? El Nino should be dry and humid. But why is it raining all day ? No, this is not going to be the first time, in fact El Nino season will commence with rains pouring in its early phase. Therefore, farmers and ordinary people alike should take advantage of the heavy rains to store any rainwater we could manage to store to combat moderate to strong El Nino drought in the coming months. Farmers can build water ponds or set up water-collecting drums too.
Aside from the drought, I think it is the best time for this insensitive government to take a look @ the heavy floods we see everywhere in the country, a tangible problem to work with if it wants to epitomize its Bagong Pilipinas brand, as for too long, floods had been a major problem that chafed my head from scratching, from slow traffic that can dwindle our economic growth to life threatening illnesses, no matter what, this problem must be solved as soon as possible. 
I hope our politicians will always prioritize it’s people’s welfare first, instead of filling their pockets with whatever they could get their hands on, especially the flood-control projects that can’t control floods, sub-standard roads and bridges, culverts that’s for sure a wasted money because of its unreliability in the long run.  How can we Love the Philippines if it’s this unlovable?  Maybe they were referring to the kind of love that 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 in the Bible says, love is patient, love is kind, it does not bring dishonor and etc…, but I am writing this because I love the Philippines, not because I love the government that’s currently running it.  And that’s how our government preys on us, our predominantly Catholic / Christian upbringing makes us susceptible to endure hardships than to complain and take action, as it is ingrained in our psyche to live a modest life, free from luxuries, humility, patience, and that’s what the government uses to take advantage of us, that’s the same reason why Rizal joined the Freemasonry movement not because he abhorred Catholic’s teachings but the leaders of it who took advantage of the teachings to abuse others, mostly the prayles, as the state and the church were one before.  Unlike the type of love that the romantic Frenchmen and women had who always take their frustrations out in the streets of France expressing their dissatisfaction towards unjust wage, that’s the kind of love that I admire, the one that don’t repress.  For silence is the voice of the oppressed
