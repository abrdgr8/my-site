# Special Thanks to Render for helping me publish this site.

I just miss the wordpress style of publishing blogs, but there was some things that I need to fix in my wordpress app before using it,   I don't wanna lie to people but I had some issues with Wordpress , thankfully I had some web development background, now I can blog anywhere thanks to Render.
